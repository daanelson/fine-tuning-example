In addition to brining in qualified employees, I believe it's intent is to reject qualified candidates. Those qualified candidates will end up being engineering leaders in companies that Google interacts with and the more that they can maintain the impression that Google engineers are the best of the best, the easier those interactions will be and the better received Google products will be.

And that's just my armchair assessment that ignores the myriad complications of spaceflight.\n",

Adobe was brilliant: They gave away InDesign for next to nothing -- made it THE upgrade path to their PageMaker users and owned the market. My understanding was that Quark was a private company so they never had the cash to go after Adobe, also unlike Adobe they were a one product company (and their multimedia offering was terrible).\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\":\"Write a response to the following message:\\nI agree with you to some degree. Higher order functions should be used wherever possible and there should be some alternatives to LOOP for the common cases such as iterating over a range of numbers. It is much easier to understand patterns when they are built into the language than when they are written out using LOOP.\\nThe thing is LOOP is very good at creating ad hoc kinds of loops. Say you are writing a loop to do password validation. Repeat at most N times and then lock the account or go through once a correct password is entered. That kind of iteration is too specific for pretty much any kind of looping construct besides LOOP.\\nAs I see it, LOOP is not about creating \\\"one macro to rule them all\\\", it's about creating a macro that's a catch-all. One that you can always use when nothing else quite describes what you want.\\nI'm just thinking out loud.\",\"completion\":\"I would probably use DO for the password validation example.  It's strange to me that people think of DO as complicated; there is a little complexity there, to be sure, but much less than for LOOP.  Once you understand that the inits and updates are done in parallel, and you get where the exit test goes, you've got it; there are no more rules to learn.\\nI understand that LOOP seems simple in simple cases, but that simplicity is evidently deceptive, as attested by the comments I was replying to.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\":\"Write a response to the following message:\\nOh, wow, 1000x this article. Forget about the crying thing, which makes it vivid and more interesting to read but might obscure the fundamental point, which is that interviews make people incredibly uncomfortable. Some of the calmest, most unflappable people I work with shook visibly in their interviews with us.\\nWhat's important about that is: you are not getting an accurate read of a candidate's state of mind in a high-stakes interview. I think you have just a couple of options to improve your accuracy given that fact:\\n* You can take deliberate steps to lower the stakes in your interview process by changing the kinds of transactions that happen in the interview (for instance, by constructing interviews that involve collaborating on a problem instead of challenging the candidate).\\n* You can \\\"discount\\\" the signals you get from the interview, particular w\\/r\\/t already nebulous concepts like \\\"confidence\\\", \\\"social skill\\\", \\\"enthusiasm\\\", and the dreaded \\\"culture fit\\\".\\n* You can push more of the recruiting process into situations where the candidate controls their environment (for instance, by doing stuff at home, and on a fixed but flexible time scale) and less on in-person timeboxed interviews.\\nI'd love more ideas. We're trying all three, but it's a lather-rinse-repeat kind of situation. I'm getting good, I think, at spotting signals that are probably the result of jitters. And I think I've learned pretty conclusively that those jitters have zero correlation to on-the-job performance. But I have so much more to learn.\",\"completion\":\"> You can take deliberate steps to lower the stakes in your interview process by changing the kinds of transactions that happen in the interview (for instance, by constructing interviews that involve collaborating on a problem instead of challenging the candidate).\\nIf you want to evaluate all candidates on a level playing field, this can be really hard to pull off.\\nI work in the defense sector. We have some pretty strict guidelines on how we're supposed to evaluate people. Because of those guidelines, we often try to give each batch of candidates the same general set of questions\\/challenges, etc. We do try to be collaborative during our interviews, but it's really tough to collaborate without leading when you've worked a particular problem 1,000 times.\\nFurther, even when you do this well, the candidate often interprets your help as their failure. \\\"Oh crap, he pointed me in a different direction, he must think I'm an idiot.\\\"\\n> You can push more of the recruiting process into situations where the candidate controls their environment (for instance, by doing stuff at home, and on a fixed but flexible time scale) and less on in-person timeboxed interviews.\\nI think this is really key to our success. Our interview focuses on two programming problems which require you to interpret imperfect requirements, ask questions if you deem it necessary, provide an estimate of when you think you'll complete your work, code\\/document\\/test two full applications (one per problem). We ask the candidate to do this well before the interview, on their own time. Typically we don't discount for how long it takes a candidate to complete their work. I've had awful submissions which took someone 40 hours, and excellent submissions which took someone 4 hours, and vice versa.\"}\n",
